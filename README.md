# C-UNISA-PROJECTS-
This repository contains some sample projects I have created in C++ when I began learning to code at the University of South Africa (UNISA) , These projects range from classes implemented as console applications to sample GUI applications built in c++ using QT framework. 

I will be adding more projects as I progress in my programming journey at university and beyond 


All of my source code is open source and may be altered ,studied ,played with in order to help future developers provided any changes are documented and the code structure is not changed completely and my work is acknowledged. I have used Copilot to debug my code 

In future I will be adding SQL sample files for database manipulation  and Python
Ready to learn more  ðŸ˜Š
